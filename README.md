## Compatibility

The Enjin C# SDK is targeted for .NET Standard 2.0.

## Installation

This SDK is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Enjin.Sdk.CSharp) and may be installed with the
following package manager command:

```
PM> Install-Package Enjin.Sdk.CSharp
```

## Quick Start

This example showcases how to quickly create and authenticate a client on the project schema which will then allow us to
make further requests to the platform.

```c#
using System;
using Enjin.SDK;
using Enjin.SDK.Graphql;
using Enjin.SDK.Models;
using Enjin.SDK.ProjectSchema;

public static class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Builds the project client to run on the Kovan test network.
        // See: https://kovan.cloud.enjin.io to sign up for the test network.
        ProjectClient client = ProjectClient.Builder()
                                            .BaseUri(EnjinHosts.KOVAN)
                                            .Build();

        // Creates the request to authenticate the client.
        // Replace the appropriate strings with the project's UUID and secret.
        AuthProject req = new AuthProject()
            .Uuid("<the-project's-uuid>")
            .Secret("<the-project's-secret>");

        // Sends the request to the platform and gets the response.
        GraphqlResponse<AccessToken> res = client.AuthProject(req).Result;

        // Checks if the request was successful.
        if (!res.IsSuccess)
        {
            Console.Out.WriteLine("AuthProject request failed");
            client.Dispose();
            return;
        }

        // Authenticates the client with the access token in the response.
        client.Auth(res.Result.Token);

        // Checks if the client was authenticated.
        if (client.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            Console.Out.WriteLine("Client is now authenticated");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.Out.WriteLine("Client was not authenticated");
        }

        // Dispose client as part of cleanup and free any resources.
        client.Dispose();
    }
}
```
